            <h1>The Noble Prophetic Lineage: A Study of the Roots of Divine Selection and the History of Authentic Arab Heritage</h1>
        </header>

         <section id="intro" data-nav-title="Introduction">
            <h2>Introduction: The Importance of Studying the Prophetic Lineage and Its Significance in Understanding the Sirah (Prophetic Biography)</h2>
            <p>All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, and peace and blessings be upon the noblest of messengers, our Prophet Muhammad <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ - <i>Sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam</i>)</span>, and upon his family, companions, and those who follow them in righteousness until the Day of Judgment.</p>
            <p>The study of the fragrant Prophetic Sirah is one of the noblest acts of devotion and greatest branches of knowledge, for it is a window through which we view the life of the best of humanity, the master of the children of Adam, Muhammad ibn Abdullah <span class="arabic-term">(محمد بن عبد الله ﷺ - <i>Muhammad ibn Abdillah, Sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam</i>)</span>. Within this framework, the study of the noble Prophetic lineage holds a special and paramount importance. It is not merely a review of a series of names and ancestors, but rather a profound journey into the history of divine selection, and a contemplation of the profound divine wisdom in choosing this noble Prophet from the purest and most honorable of lineages. Allah Almighty says: <span class="quran-quote">"Allah chooses from the angels messengers and from the people. Indeed, Allah is Hearing and Seeing."</span> (Quran, Al-Hajj: 75). This divine selection is clearly manifested in his lineage <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span>, as he himself informed us: <span class="hadith-quote">"Indeed, Allah chose Kinanah from the descendants of Isma'il, and He chose Quraysh from Kinanah, and He chose Banu Hashim from Quraysh, and He chose me from Banu Hashim."</span> (Narrated by Muslim). This noble Hadith alone is sufficient to demonstrate the importance of this lineage and its unique status.</p>
            <p>Delving into the details of the Prophetic lineage is not an intellectual luxury, but rather a methodological necessity for understanding the context of the historical and social events that surrounded the Prophet's mission <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span>. Knowledge of the tribes, their interrelations, and the influential figures in this lineage constitutes the indispensable background for understanding the Prophet's interactions <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span> with his environment, and for comprehending the nature of alliances, enmities, and the various situations that shaped the course of the Islamic call. This research into the Prophetic lineage is tantamount to laying the solid foundation upon which a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the entire Prophetic Sirah will be built.</p>

            <h2>The Historical Relationship Between Isma'il (Ishmael) and Muhammad <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span>: The Roots of the Final Prophethood</h2>
            <p>Our journey in tracing this blessed lineage begins with understanding the deep and extended relationship between the father of the Arabs, Sayyiduna Isma'il ibn Ibrahim Al-Khalil <span class="arabic-term">(إسماعيل بن إبراهيم الخليل - <i>Isma'il ibn Ibrahim Al-Khalil</i>)</span>, peace be upon them, and the Seal of the Prophets and Messengers, Sayyiduna Muhammad <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span>. This relationship is not merely a genealogical connection; it is the fulfillment of the supplication of Ibrahim (Abraham) <span class="arabic-term">(إبراهيم - <i>Ibrahim</i>)</span> (peace be upon him) when he was raising the foundations of the House (the Ka'bah) with his son Isma'il: <span class="quran-quote">"Our Lord, and send among them a messenger from themselves who will recite to them Your verses and teach them the Book and wisdom and purify them. Indeed, You are the Exalted in Might, the Wise."</span> (Quran, Al-Baqarah: 129).</p>
            <p>The history of this lineage, since Ibrahim <span class="arabic-term">(إبراهيم - <i>Ibrahim</i>)</span> settled his son Isma'il <span class="arabic-term">(إسماعيل - <i>Isma'il</i>)</span> and his mother Hajar <span class="arabic-term">(هاجر - <i>Hajar</i>)</span> (Hagar) in the barren valley of Makkah, through Isma'il's upbringing and learning of Arabic from the Jurhum <span class="arabic-term">(جرهم - <i>Jurhum</i>)</span> tribe, and then the branching and spread of his descendants, is a history replete with significant stages and momentous events that shaped the identity of the "Arabized Arabs" <span class="arabic-term">(العرب المستعربة - <i>Al-Musta'ribah</i>)</span> and prepared for the emergence of the final prophethood from among them.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="makkah-cradle" data-nav-title="Makkah: Cradle of Prophethood">
            <h2>Makkah Al-Mukarramah: The Cradle of Prophethood and the Homeland of Isma'il <span class="arabic-term">(peace be upon him)</span> and the Jurhum Tribe</h2>
            <p>When Ibrahim <span class="arabic-term">(إبراهيم - <i>Ibrahim</i>)</span> (peace be upon him) was commanded to settle his son Isma'il <span class="arabic-term">(إسماعيل - <i>Isma'il</i>)</span> and his mother Hajar <span class="arabic-term">(هاجر - <i>Hajar</i>)</span> in a valley without cultivation near the Sacred House of Allah, it was the beginning of the establishment of the first Makkan society. Allah says, narrating Abraham's prayer: <span class="quran-quote">"Our Lord, I have settled some of my descendants in an uncultivated valley near Your sacred House, our Lord, that they may establish prayer. So make hearts among the people incline toward them and provide for them from the fruits that they might be grateful."</span> (Quran, Ibrahim: 37).</p>
            <p>After the well of Zamzam <span class="arabic-term">(زمزم - <i>Zamzam</i>)</span> gushed forth as a divine blessing, life began to emerge in this place. The Jurhum <span class="arabic-term">(جرهم - <i>Jurhum</i>)</span> tribe, an authentic Arab tribe <span class="arabic-term">(عرب عاربة - <i>Arab Aribah</i>)</span> from Yemen, was among the first to inhabit Makkah and settle there alongside Isma'il and his mother. It is important to note that this tribe, which Isma'il married into, is referred to as "Jurhum II," to distinguish it from "Jurhum I," an older tribe of the same name that had perished and disappeared before them.</p>
            <p>Sayyiduna Isma'il <span class="arabic-term">(إسماعيل - <i>Isma'il</i>)</span> (peace be upon him) grew up in this Arab environment, learned the Arabic language, and mastered it, becoming one of its most eloquent speakers. He then married a woman from the Jurhum <span class="arabic-term">(جرهم - <i>Jurhum</i>)</span> tribe, a marriage that had the greatest impact on the emergence of a new branch of Arabs, later known as the Arabized Arabs, from whom Prophet Muhammad <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span> would come.</p>

            <h2>The Emergence of the Arabized Arabs <span class="arabic-term">(Al-Musta'ribah - العرب المستعربة)</span>: A Blessed Blend of Prophetic Lineage and Authentic Arabism</h2>
            <p>From the blessed marriage of Sayyiduna Isma'il <span class="arabic-term">(إسماعيل - <i>Isma'il</i>)</span> (peace be upon him) to the Jurhumite woman, a new generation emerged, possessing unique characteristics. This generation, and their descendants after them, are known in the books of history and genealogy as the "Arabized Arabs" <span class="arabic-term">(العرب المستعربة - <i>Al-Arab al-Mustaribah</i>)</span>. This term does not imply a deficiency in their Arabism, but rather indicates that their primary ancestral origin (Sayyiduna Isma'il) was not from the core of the Arabs. However, they acquired full Arab identity through upbringing in an Arab environment, intermarriage with authentic Arab tribes, and mastery of the clear Arabic tongue.</p>
            <p>Consequently, the descendants of Sayyiduna Isma'il <span class="arabic-term">(إسماعيل - <i>Isma'il</i>)</span> (peace be upon him), who represent the direct line of the Prophet's lineage <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span>, are distinguished by being:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Purely Arab from the maternal side, as their early mothers were from the ancient Arab tribe of Jurhum <span class="arabic-term">(جرهم - <i>Jurhum</i>)</span>.</li>
                <li>Arabized from the primary paternal side (Isma'il), but they became Arabs by language, upbringing, and affiliation, and indeed, among the most eloquent Arabs, thanks to the divine selection that endowed this branch with a special status.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Prophet Muhammad <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span>, and his forefathers from Banu Hashim <span class="arabic-term">(بنو هاشم - <i>Banu Hashim</i>)</span> and Quraysh <span class="arabic-term">(قريش - <i>Quraysh</i>)</span>, belong to these Arabized Arabs, who combined the honor of the Isma'ili prophetic lineage with the authenticity of Arabism.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="ismail-descendants-honor" data-nav-title="Isma'il's Descendants Honor">
            <h2>The Honor of Isma'il's Descendants <span class="arabic-term">(peace be upon him)</span> and Their Status in Islamic Texts</h2>
            <p>The descendants of Isma'il <span class="arabic-term">(إسماعيل - <i>Isma'il</i>)</span> (peace be upon him) have been accorded a lofty status and great honor, confirmed by clear religious texts. Association with this blessed lineage, as understood from the context of the Sirah, is an honor and a source of pride.</p>
            <p>This honor is evident in the Hadith of Divine Selection previously mentioned: <span class="hadith-quote">"Indeed, Allah chose Kinanah from the descendants of Isma'il, and He chose Quraysh from Kinanah, and He chose from Quraysh Banu Hashim, and He chose me from Banu Hashim."</span> (Narrated by Muslim).</p>
            <p>There is another proof of the virtue of this lineage, which is found in the noble Hadith: <span class="hadith-quote">"Whoever says: 'La ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lah, lahu al-mulk wa lahu al-hamd, wa huwa 'ala kulli shay'in qadir' <span class="arabic-term">(لا إله إلا الله وحده لا شريك له، له الملك وله الحمد، وهو على كل شيء قدير - <i>There is no god but Allah alone, with no partner, His is the dominion and His is the praise, and He is over all things competent</i>)</span> ten times, it will be as if he freed four slaves from the descendants of Isma'il."</span> (Narrated by Muslim). The Prophet <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span> making the reward of this great remembrance equivalent to freeing four slaves from the descendants of Isma'il is conclusive evidence of their high status and honorable rank with Allah and His Messenger.</p>

        <section id="arab-divisions" data-nav-title="Arab Divisions">
            <h2>The Main Divisions of Arabs in History: A Map of Genealogies and Tribes</h2>
            <p>For a deeper understanding of the demographic and tribal composition of the Arabian Peninsula, it is essential to become familiar with the main divisions of Arabs mentioned by historians and genealogists. Arabs can be historically divided into three main categories:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The Extinct Arabs <span class="arabic-term">(العرب البائدة - <i>Al-Arab al-Ba'idah</i>)</span>:</strong> These were the early Arab peoples who vanished and became extinct, leaving no trace except in historical accounts or religious texts. Among the most famous examples are <strong>Ad <span class="arabic-term">(عاد - <i>'Ad</i>)</span></strong> (the people of Prophet Hud, peace be upon him) and <strong>Thamud <span class="arabic-term">(ثمود - <i>Thamud</i>)</span></strong> (the people of Prophet Salih, peace be upon him). These were authentic Arabs, but they were destroyed due to their disbelief, obstinacy, and rejection of their messengers. Allah Almighty says about Ad: <span class="quran-quote">"As for 'Aad, they were arrogant upon the earth without right and said, 'Who is mightier than us in strength?' Did they not see that Allah who created them was mightier than them in strength? But they were rejecting Our signs. So We sent upon them a screaming wind during days of misfortune to make them taste the punishment of disgrace in the worldly life; but the punishment of the Hereafter is more disgracing, and they will not be helped."</span> (Quran, Fussilat: 15-16). And about Thamud: <span class="quran-quote">"And as for Thamud, We guided them, but they preferred blindness over guidance, so the thunderbolt of humiliating punishment seized them for what they used to earn."</span> (Quran, Fussilat: 17). The repeated mention of the stories of these extinct peoples in the Holy Quran, especially in the Makkan Surahs, was intended to provide lessons and admonitions for Quraysh and all people, so they might reflect on the fate of those who rejected the messengers and transgressed on earth. Other extinct Arab peoples mentioned in historical books include Tasm <span class="arabic-term">(طسم - <i>Tasm</i>)</span>, Jadis <span class="arabic-term">(جديس - <i>Jadis</i>)</span>, Imlaq <span class="arabic-term">(عماليق - <i>Imlaq</i>)</span>, Umaym <span class="arabic-term">(أميم - <i>Umaym</i>)</span>, and Jurhum I <span class="arabic-term">(جرهم الأولى - <i>Jurhum al-Ula</i>)</span>.</li>
                <li><strong>The Pure Arabs <span class="arabic-term">(العرب العاربة - <i>Al-Arab al-Aribah</i>)</span> (Qahtanites - <span class="arabic-term">القحطانيون - <i>Al-Qahtaniyyun</i></span>):</strong> These are the original, pure Arabs, who represent the root and origin of Arabism. It is said they were called "`Aribah" for the clarity and authentic eloquence of their language. Most of these tribes trace their origin to Yemen, and they are also known as the Qahtanites after their great ancestor Qahtan <span class="arabic-term">(قحطان - <i>Qahtan</i>)</span>. These Arabs preserved the purity of their Arabism in their early origins and had an ancient and rich history and civilization in southern Arabia.</li>
                <li><strong>The Arabized Arabs <span class="arabic-term">(العرب المستعربة - <i>Al-Arab al-Mustaribah</i>)</span> (Adnanites - <span class="arabic-term">العدنانيون - <i>Al-Adnaniyyun</i></span>):</strong> These are those who, as mentioned earlier, were not Arabs in their primary origin but acquired Arabism through upbringing, intermarriage, and language. The most famous and noblest branch of the Arabized Arabs are the descendants of Sayyiduna Isma'il <span class="arabic-term">(إسماعيل - <i>Isma'il</i>)</span> (peace be upon him), who are also known as the Adnanites after their ancestor `Adnan <span class="arabic-term">(عدنان - <i>'Adnan</i>)</span>, who is a descendant of Isma'il. From this branch came the tribe of Quraysh <span class="arabic-term">(قريش - <i>Quraysh</i>)</span>, and from them, Prophet Muhammad <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span> was sent.</li>

            <h2>The Pure Arabs: The Qahtanites and Their Ancient History in Yemen</h2>
            <p>The history of the Pure Arabs extends to ancient depths in the land of Yemen, which was the cradle of ancient and prosperous Arab civilizations. These, as mentioned, are known as the Qahtanites, after their founding ancestor Qahtan <span class="arabic-term">(قحطان - <i>Qahtan</i>)</span>. Among the most famous names in their lineage series are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Yarub ibn Qahtan <span class="arabic-term">(يعرب بن قحطان - <i>Ya'rub ibn Qahtan</i>)</span>:</strong> It is said that the name "Arabs" and "Arabism" <span class="arabic-term">(عروبة - <i>'Urubah</i>)</span> were derived from his name, in appreciation of his status and role in their history.</li>
                <li><strong>Yashjub ibn Yarub <span class="arabic-term">(يشجب بن يعرب - <i>Yashjub ibn Ya'rub</i>)</span>:</strong> He was the son of Yarub.</li>
                <li><strong>Saba' ibn Yashjub <span class="arabic-term">(سبأ بن يشجب - <i>Saba' ibn Yashjub</i>)</span>:</strong> He is a pivotal figure, and from his descendants branched many of the major Yemeni tribes. The story of the Kingdom of Saba', its wealth and prosperity, then the collapse of the Ma'rib Dam and the subsequent dispersion, is mentioned in the Holy Quran in Surah Saba'. Allah Almighty says: <span class="quran-quote">"There was for [the tribe of] Saba' in their dwelling place a sign: two [fields of] gardens on the right and on the left. [They were told], 'Eat from the provision of your Lord and be grateful to Him. A good land [have you], and a forgiving Lord.' * But they turned away [refusing], so We sent upon them the flood of the dam, and We substituted their two gardens with gardens of bitter fruit, tamarisks and something of sparse lote trees."</span> (Quran, Saba': 15-16).</li>

            <p>From Saba' ibn Yashjub <span class="arabic-term">(سبأ بن يشجب - <i>Saba' ibn Yashjub</i>)</span>, two main major branches diverged, forming the backbone of the Qahtanite Pure Arab tribes. These two branches are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Himyar <span class="arabic-term">(حِمْيَر - <i>Himyar</i>)</span>:</strong> A great Yemeni tribe, with a long history and a powerful kingdom known as the Himyarite Kingdom.</li>
                <li><strong>Kahlan <span class="arabic-term">(كَهْلان - <i>Kahlan</i>)</span>:</strong> The other important branch of Saba's sons. This branch is of particular interest in the context of tracing genealogies that will later intertwine with the history of Makkah and the Arabian Peninsula in general, and from it will come tribes that will play a role in the Prophetic Sirah.</li>

            <h2>The Migration of Kahlanite Tribes from Yemen to Northern Arabia: Historical Causes and Consequences</h2>
            <p>The Kahlanite tribes, or a large part of them, did not remain settled in Yemen but witnessed extensive migrations northward to various regions of the Arabian Peninsula. These migrations were not random but were the result of historical, geographical, and economic factors, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Flood of the Dam <span class="arabic-term">(سيل العرم - <i>Sayl al-'Arim</i>)</span>:</strong> The collapse of the great Ma'rib Dam in Yemen, which led to widespread destruction and drought, forcing many tribes to migrate in search of new resources for life.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic and Political Pressures:</strong> Changes in trade routes, or internal conflicts, may have driven some tribes to seek better opportunities elsewhere.</li>
                <li><strong>Tribal Disputes:</strong> It is possible that disputes between the two main branches of Saba', Himyar and Kahlan, may have been a reason for the migration of part of Kahlan.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These migrations led to the spread of Kahlanite tribes throughout the Peninsula, some of whom would head towards Hijaz, Yathrib, and Makkah, to play prominent roles in subsequent events.</p>

            <p>Genealogical books mention that the Azd tribe primarily branched into four brothers, and from the descendants of these brothers arose tribes and branches that spread to vital regions of the Arabian Peninsula and its surroundings. These brothers are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Imran ibn Amr <span class="arabic-term">(عِمران بن عمرو - <i>'Imran ibn 'Amr</i>)</span>:</strong> It is said he was the eldest and the leader of his people. His descendants, or a large part of them, headed towards the southeastern part of the Peninsula and settled in the region of Oman <span class="arabic-term">(عُمان - <i>'Uman</i>)</span>.</li>
                <li><strong>Thalabah ibn Amr <span class="arabic-term">(ثعلبة بن عمرو - <i>Tha'labah ibn 'Amr</i>)</span>:</strong> This branch is of utmost importance in the context of the Prophetic Sirah. Thalabah and his descendants headed north and settled in the <strong>Hijaz <span class="arabic-term">(الحجاز - <i>Al-Hijaz</i>)</span></strong> region, specifically in the area later known as <strong>Yathrib <span class="arabic-term">(يثرب - <i>Yathrib</i>)</span> (Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah <span class="arabic-term">(المدينة المنورة - <i>Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah</i>)</span>)</strong> and its surroundings. <strong>From the descendants of this Thalabah ibn `Amr came the tribes of Aws <span class="arabic-term">(الأوس - <i>Al-Aws</i>)</span> and Khazraj <span class="arabic-term">(الخزرج - <i>Al-Khazraj</i>)</span></strong>, who formed the Ansar, those who sheltered and supported the Prophet <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span> and became the solid base of the first Islamic state.</li>
                <li><strong>Harithah ibn Amr (also known as Khuzaah) <span class="arabic-term">(حارثة بن عمرو - خزاعة - <i>Harithah ibn 'Amr - Khuza'ah</i>)</span>:</strong> This branch is also of great importance in the history of Makkah. Harithah and his descendants headed to the Hijaz and settled in the region of Makkah Al-Mukarramah <span class="arabic-term">(مكة المكرمة - <i>Makkah Al-Mukarramah</i>)</span>. He is the founding ancestor of the famous Khuza`ah <span class="arabic-term">(خزاعة - <i>Khuza'ah</i>)</span> tribe, which ruled Makkah before Quraysh and played a significant role in the events of the Sirah, allying with the Prophet <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span> in the Treaty of Hudaybiyah.</li>
                <li><strong>Jafnah ibn Amr <span class="arabic-term">(جَفْنَة بن عمرو - <i>Jafnah ibn 'Amr</i>)</span>:</strong> This branch headed north towards the lands of <strong>Sham <span class="arabic-term">(الشام - <i>Ash-Sham</i>)</span> (Greater Syria)</strong> and inhabited the areas bordering the Roman (Byzantine) Empire. From the descendants of Jafnah ibn Amr came the Ghassanid Kings <span class="arabic-term">(ملوك الغساسنة - <i>Muluk Al-Ghassasinah</i>)</span>, who established an Arab kingdom allied with the Romans in Sham and were mentioned in the Islamic conquests.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This geographical distribution of the sons of Azd shows us how this ancient Kahlanite tribe spread to strategic regions, and how their descendants would play pivotal roles in the history of the region and the emergence of Islam.</p>

            <h2>Geographical Clarification of the Main Regions of the Arabian Peninsula: Tihamah, Hijaz, and Najd</h2>
            <p>To better understand the movements of these tribes and their settlement locations, it is necessary to take a quick look at the main geographical division of the Arabian Peninsula that was commonly recognized by the Arabs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tihamah <span class="arabic-term">(تِهامَة - <i>Tihamah</i>)</span>:</strong> The western coastal strip of the Arabian Peninsula, extending along the Red Sea, from Yemen in the south and stretching northward. It is a low-lying, hot, and humid land. Among its famous cities located within or on its outskirts are: Jeddah, Yanbu, and Makkah itself is located in a depression of the Tihamah valleys.</li>
                <li><strong>Hijaz <span class="arabic-term">(الحِجاز - <i>Al-Hijaz</i>)</span>:</strong> The mountainous region located to the east of Tihamah, extending longitudinally between Tihamah and Najd. It was named Hijaz because it "barriers" or separates Tihamah (the low-lying coastal land) from Najd (the inland plateau). Hijaz is the beating heart of the Arabian Peninsula, and it contains the two holiest cities in Islam: Makkah Al-Mukarramah <span class="arabic-term">(مكة المكرمة - <i>Makkah Al-Mukarramah</i>)</span> (where the Ka'bah is located and the first revelation descended) and Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah <span class="arabic-term">(المدينة المنورة - <i>Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah</i>)</span> (Yathrib <span class="arabic-term">(يثرب - <i>Yathrib</i>)</span>) (the Prophet's <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span> place of migration and the center of his first state). Other important cities of Hijaz mentioned in the Sirah include: Ta'if, Khaybar, and Fadak.</li>
                <li><strong>Najd <span class="arabic-term">(نَجْد - <i>Najd</i>)</span>:</strong> The vast plateau located to the east of Hijaz, extending into the center of the Arabian Peninsula. It is an elevated land characterized by its relative aridity. Among its most famous regions and cities are: Riyadh, Al-Qassim, and `Unayzah.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Understanding this geographical division helps us visualize the map of tribal dispersion and how Thalabah and Khuzaah (from Azd) headed towards Hijaz, the region destined by Allah to witness the dawn of Islam and its spread.</p>

            <p>One of the important points to emphasize is that Thalabah ibn Amr <span class="arabic-term">(ثعلبة بن عمرو - <i>Tha'labah ibn 'Amr</i>)</span> (from whose descendants came the Aws <span class="arabic-term">(الأوس - <i>Al-Aws</i>)</span> and Khazraj <span class="arabic-term">(الخزرج - <i>Al-Khazraj</i>)</span> in Madinah) and <strong>Harithah ibn Amr <span class="arabic-term">(حارثة بن عمرو - <i>Harithah ibn 'Amr</i>)</span></strong> (who is the ancestor of the Khuzaah <span class="arabic-term">(خزاعة - <i>Khuza'ah</i>)</span> tribe in Makkah) were brothers, both sons of Amr ibn Amir <span class="arabic-term">(عمرو بن عامر - <i>'Amr ibn 'Amir</i>)</span> (known as Mazin) from the Kahlanite Azd tribe. This means that the Aws and Khazraj (who would become the Ansar) and the Khuzaah tribe were cousins, sharing a strong bond of kinship. This kinship was not merely a historical fact but had its impact on the relationships and alliances that would later emerge, especially in the alliance of the Khuzaah tribe with the Prophet <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span> and the Muslims, which played a decisive role in events such as the Conquest of Makkah.</p>

            <p>After the Yemeni Jurhum <span class="arabic-term">(جرهم - <i>Jurhum</i>)</span> tribe had settled in Makkah for a period, historians mention that they deviated from the right path, became oppressive, violated the sanctity of the Sacred House, unjustly seized the property of pilgrims, and spread corruption. This corruption that became rampant in Jurhum led to the resentment of other tribes and the alienation of people from them.</p>
            <p>In this context, the role of the <strong>Khuzaah <span class="arabic-term">(خزاعة - <i>Khuza'ah</i>)</span></strong> tribe, descendants of Harithah ibn Amr al-Azdī <span class="arabic-term">(حارثة بن عمرو الأزدي - <i>Harithah ibn 'Amr al-Azdi</i>)</span>, who had settled in or near Makkah, became prominent. The Khuzaah tribe, known for its strength and resilience, managed to fight the Jurhum tribe, defeat them, and expel them from Makkah. Thus, the Khuzaah tribe assumed the guardianship of the Sacred House and the rule of Makkah. The rule of Khuzaah over Makkah lasted for a long period, estimated to be around <strong>three hundred years</strong>. During this extended period, Khuzaah was the sovereign power in Makkah, supervising the affairs of the Ka'bah and organizing the Hajj, and they held a prestigious position among the Arab tribes.</p>

            <p>When the Jurhum <span class="arabic-term">(جرهم - <i>Jurhum</i>)</span> tribe was forced to leave Makkah defeated, they, as narrated in the books of Sirah and history, committed a shameful act reflecting their malice and despair.

            <h2>Returning to the Descendants of Sayyiduna Isma'il <span class="arabic-term">(peace be upon him)</span>: The Direct Line of the Prophetic Lineage</h2>
            <p>After this necessary digression into the history of the Pure Arabs and their migrations, and the role of the Khuza`ah <span class="arabic-term">(خزاعة - <i>Khuza'ah</i>)</span> tribe in ruling Makkah, we now return to tracing the direct line of the Prophet's lineage <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span>, which begins with Sayyiduna Isma'il ibn Ibrahim <span class="arabic-term">(إسماعيل بن إبراهيم - <i>Isma'il ibn Ibrahim</i>)</span> (peace be upon them).</p>
            <p>Sayyiduna Isma'il <span class="arabic-term">(إسماعيل - <i>Isma'il</i>)</span> (peace be upon him), as is well known, had twelve sons. Their names are mentioned in some historical sources and in the scriptures of the People of the Book. Among the most famous of these sons, who are of particular importance in tracing the Prophetic lineage:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nabit <span class="arabic-term">(نابت - <i>Nabit</i>)</span> (or Nabayut <span class="arabic-term">(نَبَايُوت - <i>Nabayut</i>)</span>):</strong> He was the eldest son of Sayyiduna Isma'il, and from his descendants came some of the northern Arab tribes that inhabited regions in northern Arabia and Greater Syria.</li>
                <li><strong>Qaydar <span class="arabic-term">(قَيْذار - <i>Qaydar</i>)</span> (or Qidar <span class="arabic-term">(قِيدَار - <i>Qidar</i>)</span>):</strong> He is also one of the most famous and important sons of Sayyiduna Isma'il, and from his descendants would come the tribes to which Prophet Muhammad <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span> belongs, including Quraysh.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There is some disagreement among historians and genealogists as to whether Prophet Muhammad <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span> is a descendant of Nabit or Qaydar. However, the predominant and well-known view, held by the majority of scholars, is that Prophet Muhammad <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span> belongs to the descendants of Qaydar ibn Isma'il. This disagreement, in any case, does not affect the essence of the noble lineage and its authenticity, as everyone agrees that the Prophet's lineage <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span> ultimately goes back to Isma'il ibn Ibrahim <span class="arabic-term">(إسماعيل بن إبراهيم - <i>Isma'il ibn Ibrahim</i>)</span> (peace be upon them).</p>
            <p>During the period when the early sons of Isma'il lived, the actual leadership in Makkah was still in the hands of the Jurhum <span class="arabic-term">(جرهم - <i>Jurhum</i>)</span> tribe (whom Isma'il had intermarried with). However, the sons of Isma'il, due to the honor of their lineage and the status of their father as a prophet and messenger, had their own special respect and appreciation in Makkan society, and they were considered to possess religious and spiritual standing.</p>

        <section id="gap-qaydar-adnan" data-nav-title="Gap: Qaydar to Adnan">
            <h2>The Time Gap and Obscurity in the Lineage Chain Between Qaydar ibn Isma'il and `Adnan</h2>
            <p>Here we reach a very important point clearly indicated by scholars and historians, which is the existence of a time gap and a break in the accurately recorded names in the lineage chain extending between Qaydar ibn Isma'il <span class="arabic-term">(قيدار بن إسماعيل - <i>Qaydar ibn Isma'il</i>)</span> (who represents the second generation after Isma'il) and <strong>`Adnan <span class="arabic-term">(عدنان - <i>'Adnan</i>)</span></strong> (who is considered the twentieth or twenty-first ancestor of the Prophet <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span>, if we start counting from his father Abdullah).</p>
            <p>This long period, estimated to be several centuries, lacks precise and reliable historical records listing the names of all the ancestors who formed the connecting links between Qaydar and Adnan. What is mentioned in some genealogical books as attempts to fill this gap with specific names is often based on unconfirmed narrations, or taken from the traditions of the People of the Book (Isra'iliyyat), or from the ijtihad (scholarly reasoning) of historians that do not reach the level of certainty. Therefore, Prophet Muhammad <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span> himself, as reported in some narrations and accounts, when tracing his noble lineage and reaching <strong>`Adnan <span class="arabic-term">(عدنان - <i>'Adnan</i>)</span></strong>, would stop and not go further, saying: <span class="prophetic-saying">"The genealogists have lied"</span> (meaning, in what they added beyond Adnan). This does not mean denying the origin of the lineage to Isma'il, but rather signifies reservation and doubt about the accuracy of the specific names mentioned in this intermediate period. This Prophetic stance is consistent with what is mentioned in the Holy Quran in Surah Ibrahim, where Allah Almighty says about the nations that came after Ad and Thamud: <span class="quran-quote">"Has there not come to you the news of those before you - the people of Noah and 'Aad and Thamud and those after them? No one knows them except Allah."</span> (Quran, Ibrahim: 9). If Allah Almighty informs us that there are nations whose details are known only to Him, it is not surprising that there is a period in the sequence of lineages whose precise details have been lost and have not reached us in a complete and reliable manner. What is important in this context is the establishment of the noble Prophetic lineage up to Adnan, and from Adnan to Isma'il <span class="arabic-term">(إسماعيل - <i>Isma'il</i>)</span> (peace be upon him) in general, and this is the agreed-upon extent.</p>

            <h2>`Adnan: The Highest Authenticated Ancestor of the Prophet's Lineage <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span> from the Arabized Arabs (Adnanites)</h2>
            <p>Thus, <strong>`Adnan <span class="arabic-term">(عدنان - <i>'Adnan</i>)</span></strong> is considered the highest ancestor to whom Prophet Muhammad's <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span> lineage is definitively and reliably traced by all genealogists and historians. He is undoubtedly a descendant of Isma'il <span class="arabic-term">(إسماعيل - <i>Isma'il</i>)</span> (peace be upon him), although the details of the links between them are not precisely known. Adnan is considered the common father of most of the northern and central Arab tribes, known as the "Adnanite Arabs" <span class="arabic-term">(العرب العدنانية - <i>Al-Adnaniyyah</i>)</span>, distinguishing them from the "Qahtanite Arabs" <span class="arabic-term">(العرب القحطانية - <i>Al-Qahtaniyyah / Al-Aribah</i>)</span>.</p>
            <p>Between Prophet Muhammad <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span> (if we start counting from his father Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib) and his highest ancestor `Adnan, there are twenty-one (21) names (ancestors) in the direct line of descent.

            <ol class="lineage-list" start="3"> <!-- Start numbering from 3 as it continues the previous list -->
                 <li><strong>Nizar ibn Maadd <span class="arabic-term">(نِزار بن مَعَدّ - <i>Nizar ibn Ma'add</i>)</span>:</strong> (Considered the 19th ancestor of the Prophet <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span>). Nizar ibn Maadd is considered a pivotal figure in the divisions of the Adnanite Arab tribes. Nizar had two main sons, from whom most of the major Adnanite tribes branched out, spreading throughout northern and central Arabia. These two sons are:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mudar ibn Nizar <span class="arabic-term">(مُضَر بن نِزار - <i>Mudar ibn Nizar</i>)</span>:</strong> This is the branch that concerns us directly and primarily in this lesson, as it is the branch to which Prophet Muhammad <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span> belongs. The Mudarite tribes formed a large and powerful tribal bloc, with extensive influence in the regions of Hijaz, Najd, and others.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rabiah ibn Nizar <span class="arabic-term">(ربيعة بن نِزار - <i>Rabi'ah ibn Nizar</i>)</span>:</strong> This is the other major branch of Nizar's sons. From the descendants of Rabiah came famous Arab tribes that had a rich history of events and situations, such as: Banu Hanifah <span class="arabic-term">(بنو حنيفة - <i>Banu Hanifah</i>)</span>, Banu Asad <span class="arabic-term">(بنو أسد - <i>Banu Asad</i>)</span>, Banu Bakr ibn Wa'il <span class="arabic-term">(بنو بكر بن وائل - <i>Banu Bakr ibn Wa'il</i>)</span>, and Banu Taghlib <span class="arabic-term">(بنو تغلب - <i>Banu Taghlib</i>)</span>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>This branching between the Mudarite and Rabiah tribes was not merely a genealogical division but had its effects on tribal dynamics, alliances, and enmities that existed between these tribes. Although Mudar and Rabiah are considered cousins (their common highest ancestor being Nizar), there was, at times, rivalry and conflict between them, and they had differing stances towards the major events that the Arabian Peninsula experienced, including the emergence of the Islamic call.</p>

Among the most famous Qays `Aylan tribes that played a prominent role in the events of the Prophetic Sirah are: Ghatafan <span class="arabic-term">(غَطَفان - <i>Ghatafan</i>)</span>, Banu Thaqif <span class="arabic-term">(بنو ثقيف - <i>Banu Thaqif</i>)</span>, Banu Hawazin <span class="arabic-term">(بنو هوازن - <i>Banu Hawazin</i>)</span>, Banu Sulaym <span class="arabic-term">(بنو سُلَيْم - <i>Banu Sulaym</i>)</span>, and Ashja <span class="arabic-term">(أشجع - <i>Ashja'</i>)</span>.</li>

            <p>These Qaysite tribes (named after Qays `Aylan) had a strong presence in the arena of events in the Arabian Peninsula, and often took a hostile or reserved stance towards the Islamic call in its early stages, although some of their individuals and tribes later embraced Islam and played a positive role in the history of Islam.</p>

            <p>And so, we have reached the culmination of this golden chain, this noble and pure lineage, crowned with the birth of the Master of Creation, our Prophet Muhammad <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span>. It is a lineage connected to Isma'il <span class="arabic-term">(إسماعيل - <i>Isma'il</i>)</span> and Ibrahim Al-Khalil <span class="arabic-term">(إبراهيم الخليل - <i>Ibrahim Al-Khalil</i>)</span>, upon them and our Prophet be the best of prayers and peace.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion of the Lesson and Its Continued Importance in Understanding the Fragrant Prophetic Sirah</h2>
            <p>The study of the noble Prophetic lineage is an essential key to understanding many aspects of the Prophetic Sirah. It deepens our love for the Messenger of Allah <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span> and increases our faith in Allah's selection of him. It teaches us about authentic Arab values like generosity, courage, and loyalty, which Islam affirmed and elevated.</p>
            <p>Knowledge of these tribal details, relationships, and influential figures greatly assists in understanding the Islamic call, the Hijrah, battles, and treaties. Many events in the Sirah have deep roots in this ancient history.</p>
            <p>I ask Allah Almighty that this lesson has provided a clear and comprehensive picture of the noble Prophetic lineage, and that it will be beneficial. May He make it purely for His noble sake, grant us correct understanding of the Sirah, and gather us with Prophet Muhammad <span class="arabic-term">(ﷺ)</span> in Paradise.</p>
            <p>And our final supplication is that all praise is due to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, and may Allah's peace, blessings, and grace be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his family and companions, all of them.</p>
